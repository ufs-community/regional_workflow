#
# This file defines a function that gathers and returns information about 
# the WE2E tests available in the WE2E testing system.  This information
# consists of the test names, the category subdirectories in which the 
# test configuration files are located (relative to a base directory), 
# the test IDs, and the test descriptions.  These are described in more 
# detail below.
#
# The function takes as inputs the following arguments:
#
# WE2Edir:
# Directory in which the WE2E testing system is located.  This system
# consists of the main script for running WE2E tests, various auxiliary 
# scripts, and the test configuration files.
#
# generate_csv_file:
# Flag that specifies whether or not a CSV (Comma-Separated Value) file
# containing information about the WE2E tests should be generated.
#
# output_varname_test_configs_basedir:
# Name of output variable in which to return the base directory of the 
# WE2E test configuration files.
#
# output_varname_test_names:
# Name of output array variable in which to return the names of the WE2E 
# tests.
#
# output_varname_test_subdirs:
# Name of output array variable in which to return the category subdirectories 
# in which the WE2E tests are located. 
#
# output_varname_test_ids:
# Name of output array variable in which to return the IDs of the WE2E 
# tests. 
#
# output_varname_test_descs:
# Name of output array variable in which to return the descriptions of
# the WE2E tests.
#
# Note that any input argument that is not specified in the call to this
# function gets set to a null string in the body of the function.  In
# particular, if any of the arguments that start with "output_varname_"
# (indicating that they specify the name of an output variable) are not
# set in the call, the values corresponding to those variables are not 
# returned to the calling script or function.
#
# In order to gather information about the available WE2E tests, this
# function sets the local variable test_configs_basedir to the full path
# of the base directory in which the test configuration files (which may
# be ordinary files or symlinks) are located.  It sets this as follows:
#
#   test_configs_basedir="${WE2Edir}/test_configs"
#
# If the argument output_varname_test_configs_basedir is specified in 
# the call to this function, then the value of test_configs_basedir will 
# be returned to the calling script or function (in the variable specified 
# by output_varname_test_configs_basedir).
#
# The WE2E test configuration files are located in subdirectories under
# the base directory.  This function sets the names of these subdirectories
# in the local array category_subdirs.  We refer to these as "category" 
# subdirectories because they are used for clarity to group the tests 
# into categories (instead of putting them all directly under the base
# directory).  For example, one category of tests might be  those that 
# test workflow capabilities such as running multiple cycles and ensemble
# forecasts, another might be those that run various combinations of 
# grids, physics suites, and external models for ICs/LBCs, etc.  Note 
# that if a new category subdirectory is added under test_configs_basedir, 
# its name must be added below as a new element in category_subdirs; 
# otherwise, this new subdirectory will not be searched for test 
# configuration files.  Note also that if one of the elements of 
# category_subdirs is ".", then this function will also search directly 
# under the base directory itself for test configuration files.
# 
# Once test_configs_basedir and category_subdirs are set, this function 
# searches the category subdirectories for WE2E test configuration files.  
# In doing so, it assumes that any ordinary file or symlink in the category 
# subdirectories having a name of the form
#
#   config.${test_name}.sh
#
# is a test configuration file, and it takes the name of the corresponding
# test to be given by whatever test_name in the above file name happens 
# to be.  Here, by "ordinary" file we mean an item in the file system 
# that is not a symlink (or a directory or other more exotic entity).  
# Also, for simplicity, we require that any configuration file that is a 
# symlink have a target that is an ordinary configuration file, i.e. not 
# a symlink.
#
# We allow test configuration files to be symlinks in order to avoid the 
# presence of identical configuration files with different names in the 
# WE2E testing system.  For example, assume there is a test named 
# "test_grid1" that is used to test whether the forecast model can run
# on a grid named "grid1", and assume that the configuration file for 
# this test is an ordinary file located in a category subdirectory named 
# "grids" that contains tests for various grids.  Then the full path to 
# this configuration file will be 
#
#   ${test_configs_basedir}/grids/config.test_grid1.sh
#
# Now assume that there is another category subdirectory named "suites"
# that contains configuration files for tests that check whether the 
# forecast model can run with various physics suites.  Thus, in order to 
# have a test that checks whether the forecast model can run successfully 
# with a physics suite named "suite1", we might create an ordinary
# configuration file named "config.test_suite1.sh" in "suites" (so that
# the corresponding test name is "test_suite1").  Thus, the full path to
# this configuration file would be
#
#   ${test_configs_basedir}/suites/config.test_suite1.sh
# 
# Now if test "test_grid1" happens to use physics suite "suite1", then 
# we may be able to use that test for testing both "grid1" and "suite1".
# However, we'd still want to have a configuration file in the "suites"
# subdirectory with a test name that makes it clear that the purpose of 
# the test is to run using "suite1".  Then, since the WE2E testing system
# allows configuration files to by symlinks, instead of copying 
# "config.test_grid1.sh" from the "grids" to the "suites" subdirectory 
# and renaming it to "config.test_suite1.sh" (which would create two
# identical ordinary configuration files), we could simply make 
# "config.test_suite1.sh" in "suites" a symlink to "config.test_grid1.sh"
# in "grids", i.e.
#
#   ${test_configs_basedir}/suites/config.test_suite1.sh
#     --> ${test_configs_basedir}/grids/config.test_grid1.sh
#
# With this approach, there will be only one ordinary configuration file 
# to maintain.  Note that there may be more than one symlink pointing to
# the same ordinary configuration file.  For example, there may be another
# category subdirectory named "wflow_features" containing tests for 
# various workflow features.  Then if the test "test_grid1" runs a test
# that, in addition to running the forecast model on "grid1" using the
# "suite1" physics suite also performs subhourly output, then a symlink
# named "config.test_subhourly.sh" can be created under "wflow_features"
# that points to the configuration file "config.test_grid1.sh", i.e.
#
#   ${test_configs_basedir}/wflow_features/config.test_subhourly.sh
#     --> ${test_configs_basedir}/grids/config.test_grid1.sh
#
# Since the WE2E testing system allows configuration files to be symlinks, 
# the same WE2E test may be referred to via multiple test names -- the
# test name corresponding to the ordinary configuration file ("test_grid1" 
# in the example above) and any one of the test names corresponding to 
# any symlinks that have this ordinary file as their target ("test_suite1" 
# and "test_subhourly" in the example above).  Here, for clarity we will 
# refer to the test name derived from the name of the ordinary configuration 
# file as the "primary" test name, and we will refer to the test names 
# dervied from the symlinks as the alternate test names.  Since these 
# test names all represent the same actual test, we also assign to each 
# group of primary and alternate test names a single test ID.  This is 
# simply an integer that uniquely identifies each group of primary and 
# alternate test names.
#
# For each configuration file (which may be an ordinary file or a symlink)
# found in the category subdirectories, this function saves in local 
# arrays the following information about the WE2E files:
#
# 1) The list of all available WE2E test names, both primary and alternate.
# 2) The category subdirectories under the base directory test_configs_basedir 
#    in which the test configuration files corresponding to each test 
#    name are located.
# 3) The IDs corresponding to each of the test names.
# 4) The test descriptions (if output_varname_test_descs is specified in
#    the call to this function or if generate_csv_file is or gets set to
#    "TRUE"; see below).
#
# These local arrays are sorted in order of increasing test ID.  Within
# each group of tests that have the same ID, the primary test name is
# listed first followed by zero or more alternate test names.  Note also
# that to reduce confusion, we do not allow two or more configuration
# files of the same name anywere under test_configs_basedir (either 
# representing the same actual test or different ones).  In other words, 
# the list of all test names that this function generates cannot contain 
# any duplicate names (either primary or alternate).  After assembling 
# the full list of test names, this function checks for such duplicates 
# and exits with an error message if any are found.
#
# The following input arguments to this function specify the names of 
# the arrays in which each of the quantities listed above should be 
# returned (to the calling script or function):
#
#   output_varname_test_names
#   output_varname_test_subdirs
#   output_varname_test_ids
#   output_varname_test_descs
#
# If any of these is not specified in the call to this function, then 
# the corresponding quantity will not be returned to the calling script
# or function.
#
# The test descriptions are headers consisting of one or more bash-style
# comment lines at the top of each ordinary test configuraiton file.
# They are extracted from each such file and placed in a local array only 
# if one or both of the following conditions are met:
#
# 1) The user explicitly asks for the descriptions to be returned by 
#    specifying in the call to this function the name of the array in 
#    which to return them (by setting a value for the argument 
#    output_varname_test_descs).  
# 2) A CSV file summarizing the WE2E tests will be generated (see below)
#
# For convenience, this function can generate a CSV (comma-separated 
# value) file containing information about the WE2E tests.  If it does,
# the file will be placed in the main WE2E testing system directory 
# specified by the input argument WE2Edir.  The CSV file can be read 
# into a spreadsheet in Google Sheets (or another similar tool) to get
# an overview of all the available WE2E tests.  
#
# A CSV file will be generated in the directory specified by WE2Edir if 
# one or more of the following conditions hold:
#
# 1) The input argument generate_csv_file is set to "TRUE" in the call
#    to this function.
# 2) The input argument generate_csv_file is not set in the call to this 
#    function, and a CSV file does not already exist. 
# 3) The input argument generate_csv_file is not set in the call to this 
#    function, a CSV file already exists, and the modification time of 
#    at least one category subdirectory in category_subdirs is later 
#    than that of the CSV file, i.e. the existing CSV file needs to be 
#    updated because the test configuration files may have changed in 
#    some way.
#
# A CSV file is not generated if generate_csv_file is explicitly set to 
# "FALSE" in the call to this function (regardless of whether or not a 
# CSV file already exists).  If a CSV file is generated, it is placed in 
# the directory specified by the input argment WE2Edir, and it overwrites 
# any existing copies of the file in that directory.

# "$", "(", ")", etc will be interpreted as indicating the value of a
# variable, the start of an array, the end of an array, etc, and lead to
# errors.  Thus, below, when forming the array that will be passed to
# eval, we will surround each element of the local array test_descs
# in single quotes.  However, the test descriptions themselves may
# include single quotes (e.g. when a description contains a phrase such
# as "Please see the User's Guide for...").  In order to treat these
# single quotes literally (as opposed to as delimiters indicating the
# start or end of array elements), we have to pass them as separate
# strings by replacing each single quote with the following series of
# characters:
#
#   '"'"'
#
# In this, the first single quote indicates the end of the previous
# single-quoted string, the "'" indicates a string containing a literal
# single quote, and the last single quote inidicates the start of the
# next single-quoted string.
#
# For example, let's assume there are only two WE2E tests to consider.
# Assume the description of the first is
#
#   Please see the User's Guide.
#
# and that of the second is:
#
#   See description of ${DOT_OR_USCORE} in the configuration file.
#
# Then, if output_varname_test_descs is set to "some_array", the
# exact string we want to pass to eval is:
#
#   some_array=('Please see the User'"'"'s Guide.' 'See description of ${DOT_OR_USCORE} in the configuration file.')
#
    test_descs_esc_sq=()
    for (( i=0; i<=$((num_tests-1)); i++ )); do
      test_descs_esc_sq[$i]=$( printf "%s" "${test_descs[$i]}" | \
                               sed -r -e "s/'/'\"'\"'/g" )
    done
    test_descs_str="( "$( printf "'%s' " "${test_descs_esc_sq[@]}" )")"
    eval ${output_varname_test_descs}="${test_descs_str}"
