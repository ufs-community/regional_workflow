# TEST PURPOSE/DESCRIPTION:
# ------------------------
#
# This test checks the capability of the workflow to retrieve from NOAA 
# HPSS files generated by the HRRR external model from which ICs (and 
# the LBCs at the 0th forecast hour) will be derived and files from the 
# RAP external model from which the LBCs (except for the ones at the 0th 
# forecast hour) will be derived.
