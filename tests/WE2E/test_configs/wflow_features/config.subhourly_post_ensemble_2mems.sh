# 
# TEST PURPOSE/DESCRIPTION:
# ------------------------
#
# This test checks the capability of the workflow to run ensemble forecasts
# that require the forecast model to write output files and perform post-
# processing on a sub-hourly time interval.
#
# This test is needed in addition to the one named "subhourly_post" 
# because in the jinja template file from which the rocoto workflow XML
# is generated, the code changes that were made to add the subhourly
# capability also involved changes to the ensemble capability.
