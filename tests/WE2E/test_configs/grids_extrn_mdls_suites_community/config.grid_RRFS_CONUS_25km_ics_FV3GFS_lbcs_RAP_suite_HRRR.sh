#
# TEST PURPOSE/DESCRIPTION:
# ------------------------
#
# This test is to ensure that the workflow running in community mode 
# completes successfully on the RRFS_CONUS_25km grid using the HRRR
# physics suite with ICs derived from the FV3GFS and LBCs derived from 
# the RAP.
#
# Note that this test specifies the file format of the FV3GFS external
# model data (from which to generate ICs) to be "grib2" as opposed to 
# the default value of "nemsio".
