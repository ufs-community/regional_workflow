# forecast experiments under a specified base directory (expts_basedir).  
# It must be supplied exactly one argument, which is the full path to the
# experiments base directory.  
# 
# The script first determines which of the subdirectories under the base 
# directory represent active experiments (see below for how this is done).
# For all such experiments, it calls the workflow (re)launch script to 
# update the status of the workflow and prints the status out to screen.
# It also generates a summary status file in the base directory that 
# contains the last num_tail_lines lines (defined below) of each experiment's 
# workflow log file [which is generated by the (re)launch script] and thus 
# has information on which tasks may have succeeded/failed].

# mean a subdirectory that (1) contains a forecast experiment (i.e. was
# was created by the experiment generation scripts) and (2) does not 
# represent an old experiment whose workflow status is no longer relevant.
# For this purpose, for each element in subdirs_list, we: 
#
# 1) Change location to the subdirectory.
#
# 2) Check whether an experiment variable definitions file (var_defns.sh)
#    exists.  If so, we assume the subdirectory is an experiment directory.
#    If not, we assume it is not, in which case the subdirectory will 
#    not be added to the list of active experiment subdirectories.
#
# 3) If the subdirectory is an experiment directory, ensure that it is
#    an active experiment, i.e. that it is not an old experiment that 
#    has been renamed and whose experiment status is thus irrelevant.  
#    For this purpose, we source the variable definitions file in order
#    to have available the workflow variable EXPT_SUBDIR that contains
#    the name of the experiment when it was first created.  If this 
#    matches the name of the current subdirectory, then add the latter 
#    to the list of active experiment subdirectories; otherwise, do not.  
#    In the latter case, we are assuming that the original experiment 
#    subdirectory was renamed (e.g. to something like the orginal name 
#    with the string "_old001" appended) and thus does not contain an 
#    active experiment whose workflow status is of interest.
#
# 4) Change location back to the experiments base directory.
